# Phase 12.5 – UX Finalization & Quality Lock (UI-Only)

## Copy & UI Tweaks
- Welcome: streamlined helper text to a concise continuation prompt.
- Case list empty state: short, neutral guidance to create a case.
- Case detail empty state: concise Quick Scan vs Document Set guidance; heading clarified.

## Screens Affected
- Welcome screen (login_page.dart)
- Case list (tap_manage_page.dart)
- Case detail (tap_page.dart)

## Confirmation
- No logic or flow was modified.
- Core engines and navigation remain untouched.

## Notes
- Tests not run (UI-only changes).
- iOS screenshots needed: Welcome, empty case list, empty case detail.
